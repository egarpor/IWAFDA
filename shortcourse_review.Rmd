This page contains a combination of traditional lecture materials (slides) and code demonstrating the relevant methods. The short course will proceed by working through both. We will use several recent packages in our examples; see the [About](./About.html) page for information about the package versions.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(grpreg)
library(splines)
library(refund)
library(refund.shiny)
